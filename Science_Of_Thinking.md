# The Science of Thinking: Understanding Cognitive Systems

## Dual-Process Theory of Cognition

### System 1 (Gun) vs. System 2 (Drew)
| **System 1 (Gun)** | **System 2 (Drew)** |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Fast, automatic | Slow, effortful |
| Processes 11M bits/sec (sensory input) | Limited to ~50 bits/sec |
| Operates unconsciously | Conscious thought |
| Uses long-term memory | Relies on working memory |
| Prone to cognitive biases | Capable of logical reasoning |

**Example**: Bat & Ball Problem  
- *System 1 Answer*: "10¢" (incorrect)  
- *System 2 Answer*: "5¢" (requires verification: $1.05 + $0.05 = $1.10)

## Key Cognitive Concepts

### 1. Working Memory Limitations
- **Capacity**: 4-5 novel items (e.g., random digits: 6 7 5 5 3 1)
- **Chunking**: Grouping info using prior knowledge (e.g., "2017" vs. 7-1-0-2)
  - *Expert chess players*: Remember board positions via pattern chunks

### 2. Skill Automation
- **Process**:  
  `Conscious Practice (Drew) → Repetition → Automatic Execution (Gun)`
- **Examples**:
  - Tying shoelaces
  - Musicians' "muscle memory"
  - Driving routes (GPS dependency prevents automation)

### 3. Cognitive Effort Indicators
- **Physiological Signs**:
  - Pupil dilation (observed in "Add-1/Add-3" tasks)
  - Increased heart rate
  - Sweat production

## Practical Implications

### Education & Learning
- **Ineffective**: Passive lectures (easily filtered by System 1)
- **Effective Methods**:
  - Peer instruction
  - Problem-solving workshops
  - Desirable difficulties (e.g., hard-to-read fonts improve retention by 50%)

### Advertising
- **Traditional**: Clear messages (ignored by automated System 1)
- **Modern**: Confusing cues (e.g., "Un" campaign) force System 2 engagement

### Daily Life Hacks
1. **For Better Decisions**:
   - Use disfluent fonts for important notes
   - Add verification steps (e.g., "If ball=10¢, then bat=$1.10 → Total=$1.20?")
2. **Skill Mastery**:
   - Deliberate practice > repetitive "autopilot" practice
   - Embrace discomfort (learning happens when System 2 is active)

## Cognitive Challenge
**Try This**:  
1. Perform the "Add-3" task with these numbers: `4 8 2 6`  
   *(Answer: 7 1 5 9)*  
2. Observe your pupil dilation in a mirror during the task.

**Reflect**:  
When did you last engage System 2 to question an automatic assumption (like the bat/ball problem)? Keep a "cognitive bias journal" for a week.
